    "YOLOv1 finally uses a fully connected layer to directly predict the bounding box, where the width and height of the bounding box are relatively the size of the entire picture, and because there are objects of different scales and aspect ratios in each picture, there is no reference frame. It is difficult to learn to adapt to the shape of different objects during training, which also causes it to perform poorly in terms of accurate positioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Faster RCNN uses anchors, as long as it predicts the offset (the offset between the predicted value and the anchor box). RPN convolves the feature map obtained by the CNN feature extractor to predict the location Bounding boxes and confidence (whether or not they contain objects), and different locations and a priori boxes with different scales are set. RPN predicts the offsets of the bounding box relative to the prior box. Using the prior box makes the model easier to learn.\n",

This is done so that there can be an odd number of grid positions on the feature map, and the dimensions are odd, so that the center of the object has exactly one center grid. In particular, the center of a large object often occupies multiple grids, and we hope to predict it with one grid instead of multiple. The downsampling of the YOLO convolution layer is divided by 32 (5 times max pooling 2 ^ 5 = 32), so the input image is 416, so the feature map can get a 13 * 13 grid.\n",

The first is that the dimensions (length and width) of the anchor box need to be manually specified, with a certain degree of subjectivity. If the selected prior box dimensions are appropriate, the model is easier to learn and thus makes better predictions. Therefore, we use k-means clustering algorithm to let the bounding boxes automatically select the dimensions (length and width) that are more suitable for the prior box, and make faster and better predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "When using YOLO with anchor boxes, the second problem encountered is that the model is unstable, especially in early iterations. Most of the instability comes from the prediction of the box position (x, y), because What it predicts is the offset between the prediction box and the anchor box. The prediction value t and the coordinates (x, y) of the anchor box are calculated as follows:\n",

    "YOLO2 does not directly predict the offset of the prior box anchor box and the prediction box bounding box like RPN, but like YOLO, it predicts the offset of the center of the prediction box relative to the grid unit. YOLO2 uses a logistic activation function The prediction value of the network (the offset of the center of the prediction frame relative to the grid unit) is limited to 0-1, so that the offset of the prediction frame will not exceed one grid, and the model is more stable. Each grid on the feature map predicts 5 (k = 5 in k-means) bounding boxes (piror boxes), and the grid predicts 5 values for each bounding boxes: tx, ty, tw, th, to."

    "### 8. Improved algorithm 6: propose a passthrough layer, which is good for small target detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The input image size of YOLOv2 is 416 * 416. After 5 times of maxpooling, a feature map of 13 * 13 size is obtained, and convolution is used for prediction based on this feature map. A feature map of size 13 * 13 is sufficient for detecting large objects, but a finer feature map is also needed for small objects. Therefore, the SSD uses multi-scale feature maps to detect objects of different sizes. The more detailed feature maps in the front can be used to predict small objects. YOLOv2 proposes a passthrough layer to take advantage of finer feature maps. The Fine-Grained Features used by YOLOv2 is a feature map with a size of 26 * 26 (the input of the last maxpooling layer). For the Darknet-19 model, it is a feature map with a size of 26 * 26 * 512. The passthrough layer is similar to the shortcut of the ResNet network. It takes the higher-resolution feature map as an input, and then connects it to the lower-resolution feature map. The front feature map dimension 26x26 is twice as much as the back feature map 13 * 13. Passthrough is to directly divide the 26x26x512 image into four parts, LT, RT, LB, RB, and then concatenate to form a 13x13x2048 feature map. The 13 * 13 * 1024 feature maps are connected together to form a 13 * 13 * 3072 feature map, which is conducive to the detection of small targets."

Use the WordTree method to combine the datasets, combine the COCO detection dataset with the first 9000 classes of the full ImageNet release to create our combined dataset. ImageNet is a much larger dataset, so we balance the dataset by oversampling COCO so that ImageNet is only a little larger than 4: 1.
