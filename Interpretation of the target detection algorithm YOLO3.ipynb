    "\n",
    "Each bounding box may contain multiple types of objects, that is, multi-label prediction. So logistic (sigmoid) is used instead of softmax, because softmax indicates that each box has only one type of object, and sigmoid can predict multi-label classification . So how to use sigmoid for multi-label classification? In fact, a sigmoid classifier is applied to the results of each classification calculation in logits to determine whether the sample belongs to a certain category. During training, a binary cross-entropy loss function is used for class prediction."

    "### 3. Combine the characteristics of different convolutional layers to extract more fine-grained information and make multi-scale predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO3 uses three different scales to predict the boxes. The network uses a similar feature pyramid concept to extract features from different scales. Several new convolutional layers were added to the original basic feature extractor . Finally, a 3-dimensional tensor was used to represent the bounding box, objectness, and class predictions. In COCO, 3 boxes are predicted on each scale, so the tensor is N * N * [3 * (4 + 1 + 80)], which corresponds to 4 bounding boxes, 1 objectness prediction, and 80 class predictions, respectively. . Next, extract the feature map from the previous two layers and upsample it 2 times. Take a feature map from an earlier network and use tandem to merge it with the up-sampled features. This approach allows us to obtain more meaningful semantic information from the up-sampled features and finer-grained information from earlier feature maps. Then add some convolutional layers to process this combined feature map, and finally predict a similar tensor , although it is now twice the size. Perform the same design again to predict the size of the final box. In the past, YOLO had difficulty predicting small objects, but now it has improved significantly through multi-scale prediction.\n"
